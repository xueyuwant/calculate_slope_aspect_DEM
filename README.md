# calculate_slope_aspect_DEM
DEM Slope and Aspect Calculation
This Python script calculates the slope and aspect from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The algorithm used for these calculations follows the same principles as ArcGIS, using a Sobel operator for gradient calculation. The results can be used for various geospatial analyses such as terrain modeling, hydrology, and landform classification.
